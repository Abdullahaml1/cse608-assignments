 Main points:
 =============
 - VR game software system and dashboard.
 - Each game achievement adds values to dashboard.
 - Instructor specifies which parts are put for each student level.
 - Games types (design, exploratiion, assembly and puzzles).
 - Each instructor specifies the game type related to his course.
 - The VR game system is connected to the database that contains details to specific course.
 - The instructor have pre-defind tasks that each student can achieve.
 
 Class diagram points
 ====================
 - The veiw section shouldn't have any data that is related to the database. Instead, it should have methods to fetch such data.
 - The attributes of each class are assigned to each object. So, there is no need to add _object in their name. :P 
 - login form should be attached to the veiw no the controller.
 - The userInfo class determines which method shall fetch from database.
 - Student and instructor can't have the same dashboard controller.
